✅ Step 1: Self-Assessment Questions (Mind-Level Awareness)
Ask users 20+ reflective chakra-aligned questions like the ones you provided. Each question is tied to a chakra center:


Chakra	Sample Questions
Root (Muladhara)	“Are you comfortable with routine activities like paying bills?”
“Do you feel the universe is a safe place?”
Sacral (Svadhisthana)	“Do you feel guilty about indulging in pleasurable activities like self-care or rest?”
Solar Plexus (Manipura)	“Are you mostly able to be assertive when necessary?”
Heart (Anahata)	“Do you tend to keep people at a distance?”
Throat (Vishuddha)	“Are you often told to speak loudly and clearly?”
“Do you feel good about expressing yourself through art, voice, or writing?”
Third Eye (Ajna)	“Do you frequently rely on intuition and logic to make decisions?”
“Do you like to ideate or brainstorm creative solutions?”
Crown (Sahasrara)	“Do you seek to understand higher spiritual truths like enlightenment?”
“Do you feel all events are meaningful and intentional?”
🧠 Step 2: Hypothetical Scenarios (Behavior vs Belief Check)
Craft scenario-based questions to test how users would behave in real life compared to what they claim.

Examples by Chakra:


Chakra	Hypothetical Prompt
Root	“You suddenly lose your job. How do you respond in the first 3 days emotionally and practically?”
Sacral	“You get invited to a spontaneous beach trip, but you had planned a productive weekend. What do you do?”
Solar Plexus	“A friend constantly dominates conversations. Do you speak up or stay silent?”
Heart	“A loved one deeply hurt you. Do you express your pain, withdraw, or forgive quickly?”
Throat	“You’re asked to give a 5-minute talk at a surprise event. How do you handle it?”
Third Eye	“You have two options—one logical and one intuitive. How do you decide?”
Crown	“A major event disrupts your life’s path. Do you see chaos, or divine realignment?”
🧾 Step 3: Emotional + Energetic Response Logging
Record:

Language tone (hesitant, confident, vague, detailed)

Polarity (negative, neutral, positive)

Chakra keywords (e.g., "trust," "guilt," "truth")

🔄 Step 4: Pattern Recognition + Chakra Strength Map
Generate a heatmap or report:

Overactive, Balanced, or Blocked states

Chakra that needs healing or strengthening

Progress across sessions (if history exists)

Example output:

🔴 Root Chakra: Underactive — insecurity around survival/safety
🔵 Throat Chakra: Balanced — confident in expression

🌱 Step 5: Personalized Daily Healing Plan
Based on the analysis, generate:

Affirmations (e.g., for Solar Plexus: “I am powerful and in control of my choices.”)

Journaling Prompts (e.g., “Where do I give away my power, and why?”)

Action Steps (e.g., “Practice assertiveness in one conversation today.”)

✅ Ready-to-Use Prompt Snippet Example (Throat Chakra)
Q1: Do you feel good about expressing yourself through speaking, singing, writing, or art?

Q2 (Follow-Up Hypothetical): Imagine someone publicly dismisses your opinion in a group. What do you do next?

Q3 (Analysis): Based on your responses, how often do you feel heard or validated when expressing your truth?
